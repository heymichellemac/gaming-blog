## Review

What a phenomenal game. My second Yakuza game but first Yakuza platinum. Loved the story and couldn't wait to work through all the side stories. Really enjoyed the decision to switch to RPG for this game, for me it didn't really seem like a grind as I was having so much fun ðŸ™‚ Can't wait to play the rest of the games in the series.

## Gaming Log

- 20230206 - Loving the turn-based combat, I think I might be a turn-based RPG convert.

  - The business mini game is pretty addictive. It reminds me of that tower game [Tiny Tower](https://tinytower.fandom.com/wiki/Tiny_Tower_Wiki) where your job is to maximize the efficiency of each property by optimizing the staff and the resources available.

- 20230208 - Ichiban says life is like an RPG and loves referencing Dragon Quest.
  - If life was like an RPG I'd have a lot more money from doing side quests like Can Quest and Mahjong..
- 20230209 - The music in this game is excellent. The sad music to tug on your heartstrings, the music when you enter a battle, the ambient music for running around the city, not to mention the Karaoke songs.
- 20230211 - iconography used denote character stats like passion, intellect etc are pretty well designed. Would be curious to look into them further.
- 20220226 - Just got the platinum trophy and I'm ecstatic. What a brilliant game. I honestly didn't think I'd be able to complete the true final millennium tower but with a guide I managed it on my second attempt. Finishing the game didn't even seem like a grind because I enjoyed the loop so much. Gosh I can't wait for the next Like A Dragon!
