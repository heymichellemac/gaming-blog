## Review

Phenomenal game in terms of graphics and story. Accessibility options are also very well implemented.

Post game clean up to get the completion wasn't super fun tho. Things like traversal and lack of fast travel became super tedious. [Backloggd Review](https://www.backloggd.com/u/MichelleMac/review/639381/){:target="\_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}
