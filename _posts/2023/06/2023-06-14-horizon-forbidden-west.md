## Gaming Log

- I cannot get over how beautiful this game looks. The characters are beautifully lit and the colors used in the environment are so aesthetically pleasing.

- Traversal can be very tedious at times. It's easy to get stuck on a rock or a piece of machinery and have to interrupt your travelling to get back out. Mountain climbing is pretty slow, I realize this is probably intentional as a ‚Äúreal-person‚Äù like Aloy could only climb so fast but they could make a lot more use of grapple points to speed things up IMO.
- I can't find a way to easily compare weapons in the inventory screen. I can only compare weapons in shops that I haven't bought yet.
- The underwater aspect of the game is a nice addition but damned if it isn't claustrophobia inducing üòÖ there is an accessibility option to help with this but there is something in game you can unlock to help you reach deeper under water which is pretty cool.
- I tried to travel all the way to the West today and it was a huge journey. I got side tracked multiple times on the way by various side quests and encounters. It was a lot of fun.
- I'm enjoying the freedom of picking what quest to do at any time. Do I want to do things that are nearby or is there a particular story or quest line I want to see progress.

- Wow, pretty disappointed with the ending of this game - no spoilers but that didn‚Äôt appeal to me at all.
- I went back to try New Game Plus on the original Horizon Zero Dawn and it‚Äôs amazing to me how much of a step up graphically the new game is by comparison. In my mind Horizon Zero Dawn was incredible, and at the time it certainly was, but it‚Äôs just crazy to see the progression of the graphics, the mechanics and the menu UI.
