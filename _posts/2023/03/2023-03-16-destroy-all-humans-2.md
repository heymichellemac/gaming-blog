- The pop in on this game is super noticeable. I'm not normally someone who notices that kind of thing so it must be bad!
- I do like the aesthetics of the game though, the world itself is pretty inviting and I have a good time navigating through the menus.
- “This is the dawning of the age of aquariums” - a lot of the jokes or slight changes on classic sayings/movies etc are quite funny just like the first game.
- The PK throwing force will never not be fun to use.
