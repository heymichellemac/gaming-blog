## Review

This was a fun nostalgic game for someone who played the original back on the PS2. I enjoyed the aesthetics and the art style. Collecting and using all the weapons was quite enjoyable plus PK throwing people into space never got old.

That said, this was one of the few games where I really noticed pop-in. I normally don't see pop-in but playing on PS5 it was super distracting.

Also, for me the side missions became pretty repetitive pretty quickly so grinding out the Platinum trophy proved to be a slog. [Backloggd Review](https://www.backloggd.com/u/MichelleMac/review/758792/){:target="\_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}

## Gaming Log

- The pop in on this game is super noticeable. I'm not normally someone who notices that kind of thing so it must be bad!
- I do like the aesthetics of the game though, the world itself is pretty inviting and I have a good time navigating through the menus.
- “This is the dawning of the age of aquariums” - a lot of the jokes or slight changes on classic sayings/movies etc are quite funny just like the first game.
- The PK throwing force will never not be fun to use.
