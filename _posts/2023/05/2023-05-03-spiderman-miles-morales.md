## Review
Graphics are pretty excellent on PS5. A lot of the same mechanics as the previous game which I enjoyed.

However, unskippable cut scenes, really in this day and age? What the heck?!

Plus wall crawling is very bad. Want to crawl around a corner or over some ducting? No way not a chance.

Music and the story beats are pretty good but some plot points were pretty obvious and I saw them coming a mile away. [Backloggd Review](https://www.backloggd.com/u/MichelleMac/review/770253/){:target="\_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}

## Gaming Log

- The first thing that struck me was the scenery. I have never seen a Spiderman game set in the Winter time. Snow covers the city and it looks beautiful.
- Snow lands on your clothes during cut scenes. Great detail.
- Still not a fan of the updated Peter Parker model ðŸ˜•
- Definitely a lot of the same components of the original game. Familiar control scheme and mechanics.
- Seems like the same story beats repackaged in a new game.

- Wall crawling is very bad. Want to crawl around a corner or over some ducting? No way not a chance.
- Unskippable cut scenes, really in this economy?! Especially not being in new game plus is questionable. It's one of those quality of life thongs that should be in every game at this point.
- Music and the story beats are pretty good but some plot points were pretty obvious i.e. I saw them coming a mile away.
- The suit designs are great as usual. Really fun especially those cartoon costumes.
- Loading screens super fast on PS5, maybe a couple of seconds.
