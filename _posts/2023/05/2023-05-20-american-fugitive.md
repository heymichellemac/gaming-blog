## Gaming Log

20230508
- I think the lack of any voices for characters sort of doesn't endear me to any of the characters.
- There's no fast travel so getting to and from missions is a bit of a slog or you have to call for a car and travel to the car.
- I like the art style and the top down/isometric view of the game.
- The AI for the cars driving around is insane the more I play. Cars randomly smashing into each other or blocking my path actively makes driving around a tad frustrating at times.

- Experienced a good few game crashes on PS5 and often got stuck in weird places in the car which required a restart.

- The story of the game didn't really hold my attention but I suppose it's a good setup for the different activities you do in the game I.e. robbing, racing and blowing things up.
- My god the ai can be frustrating at times. The number of times I drove directly into another car that happened into my path almost as if on purpose and lost my time trial run are almost countless.
- The post game cleanup to finish all the time trials with a gold level weren't too difficult. They were the right level of challenge for me but any more and it would have been a lot more daunting to complete.
