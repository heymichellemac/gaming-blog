## Review

Was an enjoyable way to spend some time. A fun game to play for 20 mins or so as it's easy to jump into a quick match or two.  

Got the platinum trophy, still a ton of DLC to go back to eventually but I'm done for now. [Backloggd Review](https://www.backloggd.com/u/MichelleMac/review/777452/){:target="\_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}
