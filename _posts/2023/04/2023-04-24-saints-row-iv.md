## Review

Was pretty fun to play through the original version of this game. The graphics etc. haven't aged super well but I was able to get past it pretty quickly and I really enjoyed the gameplay.

The story... I have no idea what happened at all but I donâ€™t think that had a negative impact on me.

The trophy list is a bit crap if you're going for the platinum. Any trophy that requires you to play for x hours to achieve is so arbitrary IMO. I think a majority of people just let the game sit idle to get the trophy so it doesn't encourage any game exploration. Platinum trophy unlocked but don't yet own the DLC.
